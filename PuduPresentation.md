Weighing in at no more than 26 pounds and 17 inches tall at the shoulder, the Pudú is the world's smallest deer. They climb tree branches and stumps in order to eat leaves and shrubbery. Found in the mountains of Chile, South America, they are nicknamed Chilean montain goats.

<aside class="notes">
There are two sub-species of Pudú: the Northern Pudú and the Southern Pudú. Of the two species, the Northern Pudú is the smallest and found at higher elevations than their Southern, slightly larger counterparts. Only the males have short, spiky antlers that do not branch off like other deer.

# What it do?

   It barks when it feels threatened and if chased, the Pudú will run in a zig-zag pattern. Pudús are rumoured to die from fear-induced cardiac arrest if greatly surprised.

Pudús are easily scared animals and will bark when afraid. When Pudús are angry, their fur bristles and they beging to shiver.

# Threats to the Pudú

* Hungry dogs
* Deforestation
* Diseases
* Illegal pet trade
* Bad Pudú moms


<aside class="notes">
While pudús are severely overhunted by dogs for food, it is habitat loss that is the most inmpactful to pudú populations. Second to that are foreign diseases that the pudús may contract from interactions with dogs and people. Unsurprisingly, pudús are also sought after as cute, docile pets. But the pudús themselves may be asking for extinction as pudú mothers give very little care to newborn pudús --many pudús die before reaching adulthood.

# Conservation

Zoos
Rehabilitation programs
Nahuel Huapi National Park

<aside class="notes">
Since 2009 both the Northern and Southern Pudú are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) Red List. Pudús are being bred in captivity to reduce their infant mortality and are later released into Argentina's national park. This is fairly tricky to do since pudús are difficult to transport because they are easily overheated and stressed. The good to this is that pudús are protected in these and other national parks which are required to enforce the protection of the deer.

## Global Efforts

World Wildlife Fund
Wildlife Conservation Society
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species

<aside clas="notes">
The World Wildlife Fund aids in the monitoring of pudú populations. Reintroduced pudús are equipped with radio collars in order to track their movements to monitor the number of pudús in the region.

The Wildlife Conservation Society protects the pudú's natural habitat and tries to recreate their natural habitat for pudús in captivity.  Finally, international trade of pudú has been made illegal and is monitored by the Convetion on Internaitonal Trade in Endangered Species.
